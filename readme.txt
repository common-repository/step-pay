This plugin allows customers to pay their orders by installments, with 3 payments in 3 months. 

== Description ==

Step pay allows customers to pay their orders by installments, with 3 payments in 3 months. 
Customers will be redirected to the Splittypay platform to complete the payment: from the platform customers can: 
*   Add their credit cards or bank accounts to pay
*   Pay by installments 
*   Monitor the payment in real time

Merchants need to register to the Splittypay service to access the Step functionality as the plugin requires an API key to work properly.
A merchant, to get an API key, needs to fulfill four simple steps:
*   Connect (or create from scratch) their Stripe account
*   Fill some basic information about the business
*   Upload a logo
*   Customize the cart duration on the Splittypay platform

The Step pay plugin can work both in sandbox and live mode. Merchants can switch between the environments from the settings panel
(different API keys are required for the sandbox and live environments).
